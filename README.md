# Clone of studiokosmos.pl website 

I'm currently studing to become Frontend Developer. I have created this mockup of https://studiokosmos.pl/ for practice and as a showcase of my skillset. I tried to reproduce as much form original site as possible, though not all original features are implemented yet.

This project, like the original website is in polish.

Thank You for stopping by.

## What's inside?
I'm practicing my dev skills  by building a clone of real website. Well, maybe just part of the website, not ALL of it, we will see. :wink:

I've deciced to start the clone without Redux and Saga, maybe I will use them in future, more extensive versions. 

### What's new? _v.0.1.0_
**0.1.0:**
Home Page and "About me" page implemented with react-router.
Navigation is, for the time being, just an inactive list. Due to change in next app revision!

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
